### Editing this wiki

Have an idea for improving a page or spot a problem? Great! There is *plenty* of room for improving our directions, procedures, and FAQs. Once you've made your edits, just drop Joe a note with a link to the page. Everyone depends on these directions for their work, so he reviews all edits for things that may need additional testing. Unlike our regular repositories, edits to the wiki don't generate email notifications, so it's easy to miss these edits. Indeed, once a substantive change has been applied, we often circulate an email to let everyone know about the new procedure, improved directions, etc. Have questions about a particularly substantive edit you're thinking about? Just reach out to Joe.
